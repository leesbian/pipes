# Pipes 
An esoteric language made up of only pipe-like characters.

Pipes is based on Semicolon (http://github.com/pksunkara/semicolon) by Pavan Kumar Sunkara (pavan.sss1991@gmail.com)

**Put that in your | and smoke it**

That was shamelessly stolen from the good folks at Splunk (http://www.splunk.com)
